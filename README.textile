h2. What is this project?

This is a fork of the "buji-oauth-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/buji-oauth-demo project to demonstrate a usage of the "buji-oauth":https://github.com/bujiio/buji-oauth OAuth client for Shiro with Google Guice. The web app is protected with the Shiro & buji-oauth libraries: when a user tries to access a protected area, he'll be redirected to a specified OAuth provider (like Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to log in and send back to the app after successful authentication, authenticated and with a complete user profile.

h2. Quick start & test

To start quickly, build the project and launch the web app with Jetty:<pre><code>cd buji-oauth-demo
mvn clean install jetty:run</code></pre>

To test:
- call the "http://localhost:8080/facebook/index.jsp":http://localhost:8080/facebook/index.jsp URL by clicking on the _facebook/index_ link
- be sent to Facebook and log in
- be redirected back to the app, authenticated and with a complete user profile.

Or click on another link to be authenticated through another provider: Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo.

h2. Manual deployment

You can also deploy manually this web app in your favourite web applications server:
